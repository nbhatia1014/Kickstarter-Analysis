# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to help Louise analyze how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and fundraising goals. For this analysis, we studied 4,113 kickstarter campaigns that varied in categories, goals, pledges, outcomes, and other characteristics. We used Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Excel functions such as CountIfs to create vizualizations to help Louise analyze outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the above analysis we used Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to help Louise visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month. In order to make the data more relevant to Louise's fundraiser, we filtered the pivot tables by Parent Category and by the Years in which the fundraisers were started. We used the "Convert Text to Columns Wizard" so we could seperate the Parent / Subcategory column into a Parent and a Subcategory column. This allowed us to filter by only the Parent Category and we were able to filter to Theatre to make the data more specific to Louise's fundraiser. In addition, we filtered our pivot table to exclude the "Live" fundraisers so we were able to narrow down the data so we could analyze just the completed fundraisers. I found that this analysis was easy to understand and fairly straight forward to create. The issues that I could see being ecountered come from the Year() function. Had this step been forgotten, the Pivot Table Filters may have been difficult to create.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In the above analysis we used the CountIfs function to help Louise visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled played based on the fundraising goal amount. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
